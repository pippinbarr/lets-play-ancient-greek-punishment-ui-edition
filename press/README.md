## Description

_Sliders! Radio buttons! Dialog boxes! Menus! Progress bars! These are the instruments of our eternal contemporary torment! The ancient Greek gods would have approved! We are all Sisyphus now!_

---

_Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment: UI Edition_ is another edition in the _Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment_ series begun in 2011 and comprising: [Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment](http://www.pippinbarr.com/games/letsplayancientgreekpunishment/LetsPlayAncientGreekPunishment.html) (2011), [Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment: Art Edition Edition](http://www.pippinbarr.com/games/letsplayletsplayancientgreekpunishmentarteditionedition/) (2015), [Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment: Limited Edition](http://www.pippinbarr.com/games/letsplayancientgreekpunishmentlimitededition/) (2016), [Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment: CPU Edition](http://pippinbarr.github.io/letsplayancientgreekpunishmentcpuedition/) (2017), [Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment: Inversion Edition](https://pippinbarr.github.io/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-inversion-edition) (2019). In the _UI Edition_ the mythological punishments are reimagined as a series of conventional user-interfaces not unlike Windows 95 control panels and setup wizards. The user/player experiences the same conceptual torments, from an eagle pecking out their liver as Prometheus to an unwinnable footrace as Zeno, but represented in the familiar language of sliders, radio buttons, drop-down menus, and more. The game asks us to what extent many of our interactions with our day to day interfaces can feel Sisyphean, and whether that's actually strangely comforting. Perhaps we must imagine UI Sisyphus happy?

## History

The _UI Edition_ of the series was prompted when I assigned my introductory programming students the project to engage with the myth of Sisyphus using jQuery and jQuery UI, two highly conventional web technologies that are chiefly intended to make attractive and efficient interfaces on the web. While thinking about how I would approach the project myself I landed on the idea of a slider that would perpetually slide back down to 0 each time you set it, preventing you from ever actually escaping its dialog box. With that in mind, I decided to see if I could find UI correspondences for all the mythological torments I've included in this series since 2011. It has been a generative process and I'm fairly pleased with where I got to with a couple of them especially (Zeno is a favourite).

_Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment: UI Edition_ is also a continuation of my project to apply the game development documentation approach I've been working on with my colleagues Rilla Khaled and Jonathan Lessard. We've come to call this approach the [MDMA](http://www.gamesasresearch.com/mdma) (for me it stands for _Method for Design Materialisation and Analysis_) and it forms a fundamental part of our [Games as Research](http://www.gamesasresearch.com/) project. By making a small and nicely self-contained project, I figured it would be a good way to demonstrate the documentation process. So, if you want to, you can read a lot about the game's development by reading its [process documentation](https://github.com/pippinbarr/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-ui-edition/blob/master/process/README.md) and by going through its [commit history](https://github.com/pippinbarr/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-ui-edition/commits/master).
